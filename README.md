# Burger review website
3rd Project built during my Web Development Immersive course (nov 2014 - feb 2015). 

Medium Rare is a burger review website allowing users to sign in, access a burger
gallery, rate existing or new burgers from existing restaurants or add a
new restaurant and rate its burgers. All restaurants get automatically
located on a map visible to all users. 


## Technology used for the project 
This project was built using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Jquery and various gems such as Rmagick, Carrierwave, Geocoder, Devise. Styling done using CSS.
